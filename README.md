# Playing the Train Game

## What's the train game?

The train game is a simple game involving the 4 serial numbers found on train carriages/busses.

Your goal is to use these 4 numbers (only once each) and any addition, subtraction, multiplication and divison to make the number 10.

For example:

given "2 4 6 8"

8/4 = 2

Now the numbers are "2 2 6"

2 + 2 + 6 = 10

And therefore we win the game.

## What's this program?

A simple program to find solutions to sets of train game numbers.

## Our approach?

We want to use a binary search tree and reverse polish notation (RPN) to brute-force all possibilities.

A Train Game algorithm is currently an open problem in computing.
